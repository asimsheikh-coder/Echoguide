## 🧩 Abstract  
**EchoGuide** is an AI-assisted accessibility platform designed to make digital content more inclusive for visually impaired users. The website allows users to **hover over text to hear it spoken aloud** and enables **voice-based interactions with an AI agent** to discuss questions, theories, or content.  

This project explores how **speech synthesis, speech recognition, and conversational AI** can enhance web accessibility, providing a bridge between traditional text interfaces and voice-driven interaction.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
1. To build an accessible web interface that enhances usability for visually impaired individuals.  
2. To integrate **text-to-speech (TTS)** technology allowing users to hear text content on hover.  
3. To implement **speech-to-text (STT)** and conversational AI for natural voice-based interaction.  
4. To evaluate how AI can empower users through auditory feedback and accessible navigation.

## 🧠 Methodology  

### 1. System Overview  
EchoGuide integrates accessibility technologies to convert static websites into interactive, voice-enabled environments. It uses web APIs for speech recognition and synthesis, paired with an AI assistant for reasoning and Q&A.  

### 2. Core Functionalities  
- **Hover-to-Speak:** Uses browser-based text-to-speech for instant audio output.  
- **Voice Conversation:** Users can ask questions or express ideas via microphone input.  
- **AI Dialogue:** A conversational model provides detailed, contextual answers.  

### 3. Implementation Steps  
1. **Frontend Design:** Developed using **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS** for modern responsiveness.  
2. **Speech Features:** Leveraged the **Web Speech API** for TTS/STT functionality.  
3. **AI Agent:** Integrated an AI model to handle user queries and interactive dialogue.  
4. **Accessibility Testing:** Focused on voice navigation consistency, latency, and clarity of speech output.
